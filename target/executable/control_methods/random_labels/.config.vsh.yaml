  summary: "Automated cell type annotation from rich, labeled reference data"
  description: "A major challenge for integrating single cell datasets is creating\
    \ matching\ncell type annotations for each cell. One of the most common strategies\
    \ for\nannotating cell types is referred to as\n[\"cluster-then-annotate\"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0088-9)\n\
    whereby cells are aggregated into clusters based on feature similarity and\nthen\
    \ manually characterized based on differential gene expression or previously\n\
    identified marker genes. Recently, methods have emerged to build on this\nstrategy\
    \ and annotate cells using\n[known marker genes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0535-3).\n\
    However, these strategies pose a difficulty for integrating atlas-scale\ndatasets\
    \ as the particular annotations may not match.\n\nTo ensure that the cell type\
    \ labels in newly generated datasets match\nexisting reference datasets, some\
    \ methods align cells to a previously\nannotated [reference dataset](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/22/4688/54802990)\n\
    and then _project_ labels from the reference to the new dataset.\n\nHere, we compare\
    \ methods for annotation based on a reference dataset.\nThe datasets consist of\
    \ two or more samples of single cell profiles that\nhave been manually annotated\
    \ with matching labels. These datasets are then\nsplit into training and test\
    \ batches, and the task of each method is to\ntrain a cell type classifer on the\
    \ training set and project those labels\nonto the test set.\n"
