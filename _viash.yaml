summary: Automated cell type annotation from rich, labeled reference data
description: |
  A major challenge for integrating single cell datasets is creating matching
  cell type annotations for each cell. One of the most common strategies for
  annotating cell types is referred to as
  ["cluster-then-annotate"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41576-018-0088-9)
  whereby cells are aggregated into clusters based on feature similarity and
  then manually characterized based on differential gene expression or previously
  identified marker genes. Recently, methods have emerged to build on this
  strategy and annotate cells using
  [known marker genes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0535-3).
  However, these strategies pose a difficulty for integrating atlas-scale
  datasets as the particular annotations may not match.

  To ensure that the cell type labels in newly generated datasets match
  existing reference datasets, some methods align cells to a previously
  annotated [reference dataset](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/35/22/4688/54802990)
  and then _project_ labels from the reference to the new dataset.

  Here, we compare methods for annotation based on a reference dataset.
  The datasets consist of two or more samples of single cell profiles that
  have been manually annotated with matching labels. These datasets are then
  split into training and test batches, and the task of each method is to
  train a cell type classifer on the training set and project those labels
  onto the test set.
