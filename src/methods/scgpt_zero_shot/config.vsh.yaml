summary: "Reference mapping using cell embedding by pretrained scGPT model."
description: |
  scGPT is a foundation model for single-cell biology based on a generative pre-trained transformer and trained on a repository of over 33 million cells. Following the zero-shot approach, a pre-trained scGPT model is used to embed cells and map unlabelled cells in a query set to the reference dataset with provided annotations.
